The Patient Data Analysis project aims to analyze patient data to uncover disease trends and health patterns, providing valuable insights for healthcare providers and researchers. The project utilizes Python as the primary programming language, leveraging the Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis.

Key Components:
Data Generation: The project simulates a dataset containing patient information, including demographics (age, gender), health metrics (blood pressure, cholesterol), and health conditions (diabetes, heart disease, smoking status).

Data Cleaning: The dataset is cleaned by handling missing values, ensuring that the analysis is based on complete and accurate data.

Disease Prevalence Analysis: The script calculates disease prevalence rates by age group and gender, allowing for the identification of trends in health conditions across different demographics.

Correlation Analysis: The project examines correlations between various risk factors (age, blood pressure, cholesterol, smoking status) and health outcomes (diabetes, heart disease), helping to identify potential health risks.

Output Insights: The findings are presented in a clear format, summarizing disease prevalence and correlations, which can inform healthcare strategies and interventions.

This project serves as a valuable tool for understanding the prevalence of diseases and identifying risk factors, ultimately contributing to improved healthcare outcomes.
